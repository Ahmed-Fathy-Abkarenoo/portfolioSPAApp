# React + Vite

This single-page portfolio web application showcases projects, skills, and experiences. Built with React for smooth navigation, it highlights your work and personal brand in a modern, responsive layout.

Technologies Used:

* React: For building the interactive and dynamic user interface.
* Tailwind CSS: For responsive and utility-first styling.
* React Router: For seamless page transitions in a single-page application (SPA) format.
* React Icons: For visually enhancing the app with a wide range of icons.
* Animate.css: For adding smooth animations to enhance user experience.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
